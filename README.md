# JUnit-ErrorCollector---Junit-Assert-AssertEquals---Examples
What is Junit Assert?  

set of assertion methods useful for writing tests. Only failed assertions are recorded. These methods can be used directly: Assert.assertEquals(...), however, they read better if they are referenced through static import.

What is the ErrorCollector rule?

The ErrorCollector rule allows execution of a test to continue after the first problem is found for example, to collect _all_ the incorrect rows in a table, and report them all at once.
